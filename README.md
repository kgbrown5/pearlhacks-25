# Task Dash

To-Do List Competition Program
Created by Caroline Bryan (cgbryan1) and Katie Brown (kgbrown5) for UNC's 2025 Pearl Hacks.

#### Inspiration

Our inspiration stemmed from a lack of motivation to finish our tasks. By gamifying our to-do lists, we created social connection while increasing productivity, and we're super excited about this project!

#### What it does

Task Dash is a program that allows users to compete with friends to finish their to do lists. Users can access their own to do list and add items that are either recurring or one-time tasks. These tasks can be reordered, individually deleted, and reset each day. Users can connect and compete with friends to reach the finish line in the interface - progress is represented by the percentage of tasks each user has completed.

Users can view and edit their to do lists on the "tasks" (leftmost) page. Users can compete against their friends in the center screen, and edit their own settings and friend connections on the right screen.

#### How we built it

We built out the backend of Task Dash using FastAPI, Python for endpoint functionality, and Pydantic for data validation and modeling. Our styling and frontend functionality utilized Typescript with HTML and CSS elements.
We used Figma to create wireframes for prototyping. We also utilized Github to manage versions and allow collaboration between members of our team.

#### Challenges, accomplishments, & what we learned

Since we were a two-person team and had a limited working window, we had to significantly reduce the scope of our project from its original mockup. We decided to focus on creating a functioning FastAPI implementation - this was a challenge, as we had minimal experience creating our own APIs. However, it was incredibly rewarding and we're glad we took this opportunity to learn!

#### What's next for Task Dash

Because of the limited time frame of this hackathon, we were unable to fully implement the GUI that originally inspired this project. In the future, we plan to use React to design our user interface and implement the race functionality.
