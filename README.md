# Task Dash

To-Do List Competition Program
Created by [Caroline Bryan](https://github.com/cgbryan1) and [Katie Brown](https://github.com/kgbrown5) for UNC's 2025 Pearl Hacks.

#### 🚀 Inspiration

We wanted to tackle a common challenge — staying motivated to complete tasks. By gamifying to-do lists, Task Dash fosters social connection while boosting productivity. We’re super excited about what we built!

#### 🎯 What it does

Task Dash is a program that turns task management into a friendly competitio! Users can create and track their to-do lists, adding both recurring and one-time tasks. Tasks can be reordered, deleted individually, and reset daily.
For a unqiue, competitve edge, users can connect with friends and race to complete their lists — progress is visualized as a percentage, so everyone can see who's in the lead!

We split our interface into 3 main sections:
* **Tasks Page** (Left) – View and manage your personal to-do list.
* **Competition Page** (Center) – Compete against friends in real-time.
* **Settings & Friends Page** (Right) – Customize your experience and manage connections.

#### 🛠️ How we built it

We developed Task Dash using:

* **FastAPI & Python** – Backend functionality and API endpoints.
* **Pydantic** – Data validation and modeling.
* **Typescript, HTML & CSS** – Frontend styling and interactions.
* **Figma** – Wireframing and prototyping.
* **GitHub** – Version control and team collaboration.

#### 💡 Challenges, accomplishments, & what we learned

As a two-person team with a tight deadline, we had to refine our project scope. We decided to focus on creating a functioning FastAPI implementation - this was a challenge, as we had minimal experience creating our own APIs. However, it was incredibly rewarding and we're glad we took this opportunity to learn!

#### 🔮 What's next for Task Dash

Due to time constraints, we couldn’t fully implement the interactive GUI that initially inspired this project. Looking ahead, we plan to build out our frontend using React to enhance user experience and implement the race functionality.
