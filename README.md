# Task Dash

To-Do List Competition Program
Created by Caroline Bryan (cgbryan1) and Katie Brown (kgbrown5) for UNC's 2025 Pearl Hacks.


#### Inspiration
Our inspiration stemmed from a lack of motivation to finish our tasks. We referenced existing roommate matching apps such as RoomSync to create an app that can be used by all UNC Chapel Hill students, regardless of their housing plans.


#### What it does
Task Dash is a program that allows users to compete with friends to finish their to do lists. Users can access their own to do list and add items that are either recurring or one-time tasks. These tasks can be reordered, individually deleted, or completely cleared. Users can also compete with other friends to reach the finish line in the interface - progress is represented by the percentage of tasks each user has completed.

Users can view and edit their to do lists on the "tasks" (leftmost) page. Users can view their friends' progress in the center screen, and edit their own settings and friend connections on the right screen.


#### How we built it
We built Task Dash using ____.
We used Figma to create wireframes for prototyping. 
We also utilized Github to manage versions and allow collaboration between members of our team.

#### Challenges, accomplishments, & what we learned
Since we were a two-person team and had a limited working window, we had to significantly reduce the scope of our project from its original mockup.
